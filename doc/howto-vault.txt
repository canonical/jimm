              Vault Configuration For JIMM Development

1. Introduction

   This document describes how to configure a development vault server
   for use with JIMM when testing the vault integration is required.

2. Configuring Vault

2.1. Installing Vault

   The easiest way to install vault is to use the snap:

      $ snap install vault

2.2. Starting Development Vault Server

   Vault is much simpler to run in development mode and this is
   recommended when testing. To run the vault server:

      $ vault server -dev
   
   This will start a vault server listening on http://localhost:8200
   configure the VAULT_ADDR environment variable so that the vault
   client can communicate with it:

      $ export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200

2.3. Add Approle Authentication

   The authentication method used by JIMM is based on approle
   credentials. To use these the approle authentication method has to be
   enabled:

      $ vault auth enable approle

2.4. Create Policy For JIMM

   An access policy needs to be created for the JIMM user. To do this
   create a jimm-dev.hcl file with the following contents:

      path "/jimm-dev-kv" {
        capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list"]
      }

   The policy is written to vault with the following command:

      $ vault policy write jimm-dev jimm-dev.hcl

2.5. Create Approle Credentials for JIMM

   To create the approle credential for JIMM run the following command:

      $ vault write auth/approle/role/jimm-dev \
          token_ttl=10m \
          policies=jimm-dev
   
   Get the role_id for the role you created with the command:

      $ vault read auth/approle/role/jimm-dev/role-id

   Remember the role_id for later.

   Create a secret_id for JIMM by running the following command:

      $ vault write -f  auth/approle/role/jimm-dev/secret-id
   
   Remember the secret_id for later.

2.6. Create Key-Value Store for JIMM

   JIMM requires a location to store its secrets, create a new key-value
   store using the following command:

      $ vault secrets enable -path /jimm-dev-kv kv

3. Configuring JIMM

   To configure JIMM update the config.yaml file to have a vault stanza
   like the following:

      vault:
        address: http://localhost:8200
        approle-path: /auth/approle
        approle-role-id: <role_id from section 2.5>
        approle-secret-id: <secret_id from section 2.5>
        kv-path: /jimm-dev-kv/
