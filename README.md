# Juju Intelligent Model Manager - test

This service provides the ability to manage multiple juju models. It is
considered a work in progress.

## Installation

To start using JIMM, first ensure you have a valid Go environment,
then run the following:

    go get github.com/canonical/jimm

## Go dependencies

The project uses Go modules (https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_maintenance) to manage Go
dependencies. **Note: Go 1.11 or greater needed.**

## JIMM versioning

JIMM v0 and v1 follow a different versioning strategy than future releases. JIMM v0 was the initial release and used MongoDB to store state.
JIMM v1 was an upgrade that switched to using PostgreSQL for storing state but still retained similar functionality to v0.
These versions worked with Juju v2 and v3.

Since a refresh of the project, there was an addition of delegated authorization in JIMM. This means that users are authenticated and authorized in JIMM before requests are forwarded to Juju. This work encompassed a breaking change and required changes in Juju (requiring a Juju controller of at least version 3.3). To better align JIMM with Juju it was decided to switch our versioning strategy to align with Juju. As a result of this, there is no JIMM v2 and instead from JIMM v3, the versioning strategy we follow is to match JIMM's to the Juju major versions we support. As an example, JIMM v3 can speak to Juju v3 controllers AND the last minor version of the previous major (Juju v2.9) for migration purposes.

## Development environment

### Local:

A couple of system packages are required in order to set up a development
environment. To install them, run the following:
`make sysdeps`

At this point, from the root of this branch, run the command:
`make install`

The command above builds and installs the JIMM binaries, and places
them in `$GOPATH/bin`. This is the list of the installed commands:

- jemd: start the JIMM server;
- jaas-admin: perform admin commands on JIMM;

### Docker compose:
See [here](./local/README.md) on how to get started.

## Testing

### Pre-requisite
To check if your system has all the prequisites installed simply run `make sysdeps`.
This will check for all test prequisites and inform you how to install them if not installed. 
You will need to install `make` first with `sudo apt install make`

### Understanding the test suite
As the juju controller internal suites start their our mongod instances, it is required to have juju-db (mongod).
This can be installed via: `sudo snap install juju-db`.
The latest JIMM has an upgraded dependency on Juju which requires in turn requires juju-db from channel `4.4/stable`,
 this can be installed with `sudo snap install juju-db --channel=4.4/stable`

The rest of the suite relies on PostgreSQL, OpenFGA and Hashicorp Vault which are dockerised
and as such you may simple run `make test-env` to be integration test ready.
The above command won't start a dockerised instance of JIMM as tests are normally run locally. Instead, to start a 
dockerised JIMM that will auto-reload on code changes, follow the instructions in `local/README.md`.

### Manual commands
The tests utilise [go.check](http://labix.org/gocheck) for suites and you may run tests individually like so: 
```bash
$ go test -check.f dialSuite.TestDialWithCredentialsStoredInVault`
$ go test -check.f MyTestSuite
$ go test -check.f "Test.*Works"
$ go test -check.f "MyTestSuite.Test.*Works"
```

For more verbose output, use `-check.v` and `-check.vv`


### Make
Run `make check` to test the application.
Run `make help` to display help about all the available make targets.

## Local QA

To start a local server for QA purposes do the following:

    sudo cp tools/jimmqa.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates
    sudo update-ca-certificates
    make server

This will start JIMM server running on localhost:8082 which is configured
to use https://api.staging.jujucharms.com/identity as its identity
provider.

To add the new JIMM to your juju environment use the command:

   juju login localhost:8082 -c local-jaas

To bootstrap a new controller and add it to the local JIMM use the
following commands:

    juju bootstrap --config identity-url=https://api.staging.jujucharms.com/identity --config allow-model-access=true <cloud>/<region> <controller-name>
    jaas-admin --jimm-url https://localhost:8082 add-controller <owner>/<controller-name>
