# In order to avoid the potential entanglement of separate tests the tuples are artifically split into groups using this naming convention: (type):(2-letter test name)-(type)-(id)
# The GitHub action supports running all tests in a directory, but keeping them in a single file improves the local development experience because the CLI does not.
