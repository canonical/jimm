# JIMM Charms

Charms are a packaging tool for deploying application using Juju.
See more on charms [here](https://juju.is/charms-architecture).

JIMM has a machine charm and a Kubernetes charm for deploying the 
application on different substrates. Currently the machine charm 
is not maintained in favor of the K8s charm.

The machine charm has not yet been moved to a separate repo.

## K8S Charm
The K8S charm can be found [here](https://github.com/canonical/jimm-k8s-operator/).
